# Privacy-Preserving Bit Manipulation

This repository contains the Python implementation of a binary bit manipulation-based data transformation algorithm, proposed in our research paper:

**"Bit Manipulation Based Data Transformation for Privacy Preservation in Data Mining"**  
📍 Presented at IEEE ICAECT 2025  
🧑‍💻 Co-authored by: [Keerthinath R]

## ✨ Highlights
- Developed for privacy-preserving data mining
- Uses binary bit-level transformations
- Evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset
- 98% clustering accuracy with K-Means
- Low misclassification error
