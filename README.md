# Privacy-Preserving Bit Manipulation

This repository contains the Python implementation of a binary bit manipulation-based data transformation algorithm proposed in our research paper:

**"Bit Manipulation Based Data Transformation for Privacy Preservation in Data Mining"**  
üìç Presented at IEEE ICAECT 2025  
üßë‚Äçüíª Co-authored by: Keerthinath R

## ‚ú® Highlights
- Designed for privacy-preserving data mining
- Utilizes binary bit-level transformations
- Evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset
- Achieved 98% clustering accuracy with K-Means
- Very low misclassification error

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The original UCI Heart Disease dataset used in the research is not included in this repository due to unavailability.  
You can test the algorithm with any structured numeric dataset by adjusting the input format accordingly.
